        <hr />
        <p>I am a hard-working Computer Science student and current Treasurer of the Airsoft and Paintballing Society at Hull University (graduating in 2020). I am a massive technological nerd in many areas including Music, Cyber Security,
          Programming and Gaming. However, I also enjoy playing Airsoft/Combat Sports with friends. I have completed many different projects and gone on summer work-placements with companies such as Rolls-Royce and Fujitsu.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>Due to my past with Leukaemia/Cancer I struggled with education missing most of my primary education severely affecting my educational performance at secondary school. However, I never let that stop me doing well and I have found that
          looking back on my past and reflecting on where I am now, I have achieved something more than just beating cancer.</p>

            <p>I am currently enrolled on my third year at Hull University studying BSc Computer Science. Along the way, I have taken part in many additional activities such as starting my own Society and tried Teaching (28-day Placement). My final
              Year my project will be coding an enigma machine to demonstrate modern computer speeds. I aim to graduate with a first-class degree before moving into a Job outside of University.</p>

            <p>At Weston College I studied a Level 3 IT BTEC Practitioners extended diploma, I gained more specific knowledge that focused on the computer industry in topics such as programming, Databases and Computer Security. I graduated with the
              grade D*D*D* which allowed me to go to my chosen University but also put me in a much better position than what I came into College at. I additionally re-took my English GCSE.</p>

            <p>At Backwell School I worked to gain my GCSE qualifications. I gained a total of 5 GCSEs and at the time that was very impressive to me as I really worked hard for them (Predicted 0 in previous years). I made a lot of good friends here
              but what I really owe Backwell school is helping me achieve a high work ethic because without that I may not be where I am now. I initially wanted to attend A-Levels but made the decision to attend college.</p>

          <h3>Dissertation - Creating an Enigma Machine.</h3>
          <p>In my final year of University, I am required to do a dissertation project. I chose to develop an Enigma machine and compare it to modern day encryption methods to compare and underpin key advancements in industry. This will be done to
            recommend different ways a business can keep their data secure and help protect against cryptographic attacks such as WannaCry. Development will start November 2019 and will be coded in JavaScript.</p>

          <h3>Rolls-Royce - Creating a Evidence Database.</h3>
          <p>During My time at Rolls-Royce I experienced a lot of different areas of Cyber Security, however I also was able to make a proof of concept tool for the Forensics Department. The Forensics department didnâ€™t have a good way of keeping
            track
            of all their evidence coming in and out of the lab and using Excel had gotten very confusing. So, I coded a web portal with a Database using PHP. The solution was quite simple, but it helped them a lot and this will be the start of
            properly digitalising the Forensics department at Rolls-Royce.</p>

          <h3>Fujitsu - Creating a Risk Management Tool.</h3>
          <p>While at Fujistu I was tasked with creating a Tool to be a response to the demise of IS2. This tool took in Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities and Controls and compared them all to generate a bunch of risk metalanguage statements and rate
            the risk from very high to low. This tool was not meant to replace a risk assessment but to assist in a full risk assessment. This tool was entirely coded in C# as this was the language, I was studying at University at the time in
            hindsight this probably would have been better as a web application especially with the push to the cloud in recent years.</p>

          <h3>Agile Development - Creating a Timetable System.</h3>
          <p>While at University in my second year I took a Module based on Agile software development to start thinking in an Agile way. Over development I used a lot of new tools like Trello, GitHub, WAMP and Google Cloud. We developed a
            timetabling system to rival the system currently in place at the university allowing a student to use the timetabling system like a planner booking in slots and booking rooms all in a single system. This was leaps and bounds over what was
            already in place and we were planning to present it to the University. However, the university had already chosen to implement a new system when we finished development.</p>
