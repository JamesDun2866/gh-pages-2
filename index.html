        <hr />
        <p>I am a hard-working BSc Computer Science Graduate working at Microsoft as the Cyber Security Graduate for Front Facing Customer Technologies. I am a massive technological nerd in many areas including Music, Cyber Security and Gaming.
          However, I also enjoy playing Airsoft/Combat Sports with friends. I have completed many different projects and gone on summer work placements with companies such as Rolls-Royce and Fujitsu.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>Due to my past with Leukaemia/Cancer I struggled with education missing most of my primary education severely affecting my educational performance at secondary school. However, I never let that stop me doing well and I have found that
          looking back on my past and reflecting on where I am now, I have achieved something more than just beating cancer.</p>

          <div class="service-content">
            <p>At Hull University I studied BSc Computer Science graduating with a first-class degree. On this course I gained a significant amount of experience in the computing world such as Programming (C#, Python, SQL, etc…), Networking using C#,
              Linux Systems and Deep Learning by coding my own neural networks. Additionally, I took opportunities which allowed an introduction to teaching and managed my own society.</p>

            <p>At Weston College I studied a Level 3 IT BTEC Practitioners extended diploma, I gained more specific knowledge that focused on the computer industry in topics such as programming, Databases and Computer Security. I graduated with the
              grade D*D*D* which allowed me to go to my chosen University but also put me in a much better position than what I came into College at. I additionally re-took my English GCSE.</p>

              but what I really owe Backwell school is helping me achieve a high work ethic because without that I may not be where I am now. I initially wanted to attend A-Levels but made the decision to attend college.</p>

          <h3>Dissertation – Creating and Improving the Enigma Machine.</h3>
          <p>During my final year at Hull University I was required to complete a Dissertation project. I chose to develop an Enigma Machine in JavaScript and improve the core weakness where an Enigma could never encipher a letter as itself (Improved
            Enigma). This would be checked to ensure security against the cribbing method exploited by the bombe in WW2. The project would then compare the Enigma’s to modern encryption standards like AES. This project scored very highly with an
            overall grade of 81%, the project and full write up are available here for any intrigued readers.</p>

          <h3>Rolls-Royce - Creating a Evidence Database.</h3>
          <p>During my time at Rolls-Royce I experienced a lot of different areas of Cyber Security, however I also was able to make a proof of concept tool for the forensics department. The forensics department didn’t have a good way of keeping
            track of all their evidence coming in and out of the lab and using Excel had gotten very confusing. So, I coded a web portal with a database using PHP. The solution was quite simple, but it helped them a lot and this will be the start of
            properly digitalising the forensics department at Rolls-Royce.</p>

          <h3>Fujitsu - Creating a Risk Management Tool.</h3>
          <p>While at Fujistu I was tasked with creating a tool to be a response to the demise of IS2. This tool took in Risks, Threats, Vulnerabilities and Controls and compared them all to generate a series of risk metalanguage statements and rate
            the risk from “very high” to “low”. This tool was not meant to replace a risk assessment but to assist in a full risk assessment. This tool was entirely coded in C# as this was the language, I was studying at University at the time. In
            hindsight this probably would have been better as a web application and future placement students had the task of porting the tool.</p>

          <h3>Computational Science – Predicting Movements of a Robot.</h3>
          <p>Computational Science was the module I scored highest in at University scoring 88%. I was tasked to create a machine learning perceptron to predict the movements of a robot in 1 Dimensional space. To do this I implemented a series of
            different algorithms, Euler’s Method was used to find the values of the robot at different step sizes, Box Muller algorithm was used to add “noise” values to the data so that the perceptron could be more accurate, then finally I coded the
            perceptron using both Step and sigmoid activation functions. The full project and write up can be found here on my GitHub profile. .</p>
