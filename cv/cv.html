            <h2>Security Cloud Solutions Architect</h2>
            <p class="subDetails"> September 2022 - Present</p>
            <p>My current role at Microsoft enables me to play a pivotal
              strategic role in Microsoft's catalogue offerings. I currently
              work alongside Mark Simos (Lead Security Architect) developing
              a comprehensive DevSecOps module for Microsoft's enterprise
              support contract. The module focuses on upskilling the
              strategic and technical direction of a customer's DevSecOps
              environment, helping them shift left effectively.
              Whilst I strategically engage with Microsoft, I also
              technically engage with industry and have had several
              technical wins including displacing CrowdStrike, CyberReason,
              and McAfee out of a customer's server estate and fully
              supporting the customer to deploy and utilise Defender for
              servers, resulting in a 300% increase of billed revenue YoY.</p>

            <h2>Microsoft CyberFirst Program Lead</h2>
            <p class="subDetails"> September 2021 - Present</p>
            <p>Since joining Microsoft, I have actively led our engagement
              with NCSC's CyberFirst Scheme. Due to my leadership we have
              grown Microsofts investment in the programme with the total
              value reaching £400k per annum.
              I manage the schools outreach program, offering Cyber Security
              Volunteering opportunities across the UK, supporting 115+
              schools across 6 regions.
              I also contribute to the CyberFirst Bursary program,
              facilitating summer placements for 9 security teams across 2
              organizations in 2024, resulting in placements for 18 students
              and generating over 3.5 years of internship work.
              Students placed with Microsoft undertake impactful projects,
              contributing to our security measures or acting as customer
              advocates. Notably, one student developed a solution during
              their placement that generated £300k in threat intelligence
              sales.</p>

            <h2>Rolls-Royce (CyberFirst Placement), Cyber Security Associate</h2>
            <p class="subDetails"> June 2019 - August 2019</p>
            <p>Worked as an associate at Rolls-Royce as part of the CyberFirst
              bursary Scheme. During my time at Rolls-Royce I worked with
              Information Assurance, Cyber Operations, Forensics and Risk
              Management.
              During this experience I got my first taste of Development
              security and evaluated SAST & DAST tools for purchase as part of
              Rolls-Royce's DevSecOps program.
              This placement gave me a deeper understanding of all areas of
              Cyber Security helping me to pivot and find my niche.</p>

            <h2>Work Placement Student at Rolls-Royce</h2>
            <p class="subDetails"> June 2019 - August 2019</p>
            <p>Worked at Rolls-Royce as a placement student for a period of 8 weeks. During my time I experienced a compressed version of the IT Graduate Scheme specifically around Cyber Security. I worked with Information Assurance, Cyber Operations
              (Security Operations Centre), Forensics and Risk Management. I learnt a lot on this placement and particularly enjoyed my time in the SOC and Forensics as this felt technical but also challenging. However, working in other areas gave me
              an understanding on how the business functions and I found myself enjoying information assurance and other relevant roles.</p>

            <h2>Fujitsu (CyberFirst Placement), Risk Management Developer</h2>
            <p class="subDetails">July 2018 - September 2018</p>
            <p>Worked at Fujitsu as a Risk Management Developer as part of the
              CyberFirst Bursary Scheme. During my time I developed an
              Information Security Risk Management Tool in C# in response to
              the demise of Fujitsu's IS1 tool. The developed tool used
              multiple standards including ISO 27001, NIST and CCM Controls to
              generate risk metalanguage to form part of a full risk
              assessment.
              In hindsight this project was a precursor to many Cloud Security
              Posture Management (CSPM) tools we see today to attest cloud
              compliance.</p>

              Computer Science Teacher (Teacher Training)</h2>
            <p class="subDetails">June 2018 - July 2018</p>
            <p>Teaching experience as part of my degree program specialising in computer science with Teacher training. The course was designed to enable the student to get a degree in computer science and a PGSE after graduation.

              I worked in a school environment, learning how to apply educational pedagogies to teaching in practice. This significantly built up my soft skills and fueled a passion for helping people achieve more. 
              
              Whilst there I had the opportunity to teach basic python and Computer Theory such as deadlocks and race conditions. 
              
              Due to a change in course structure resulting in having to drop core computer science modules to pursue teacher training I dropped this course opting to prioritise computer science modules.</p>

            <h2>University Of Hull - BSc Computer Science (1st Class)</h2>
            <p class="subDetails">September 2017 - July 2020</p>
            <p>During my time at Hull University, I had the opportunity to
              study a wide range of subjects, including machine learning and
              data science systems. While my modules focused primarily on
              software development, I strategically augmented my studies with
              a keen interest in Cyber Security. This dual approach allowed me
              to cultivate a comprehensive understanding of both disciplines,
              enriching my academic experience and broadening my skill set. My
              dissertation focused on replicating the functionality of the
              Enigma Machine and comparing it to modern-day encryption
              techniques such as AES. This research endeavor not only deepened
              my understanding of encryption methodologies but also fortified
              my resolve to explore the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
