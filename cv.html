            <h2>Work Placement Student at Rolls-Royce</h2>
            <p class="subDetails"> June 2019 - August 2019</p>
            <p>Worked at Rolls-Royce as a placement student for a period of 8 weeks. During my time I experienced a compressed version of the IT Graduate Scheme specifically around Cyber Security. I worked with Information Assurance, Cyber Operations
              (Security Operations Centre), Forensics and Risk Management. I learnt a lot on this placement and particularly enjoyed my time in the SOC and Forensics as this felt technical but also challenging. However, working in other areas gave me
              an understanding on how the business functions and I found myself enjoying information assurance and other relevant roles.</p>
